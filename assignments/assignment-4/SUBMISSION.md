Brief description:
I did this project by following the implementation steps, starting with HTML, then CSS, then JavaScript. For the calculator buttons, I tried to group together the number butters but then seperate the rest of the buttons to try to make changing the colour of those buttons easier. With the CSS I used @media to help with adjusting the size of the calculator, and also added a scroll bar to the screen to prevent the numbers from moving outside of the calculator. Then I did the JS which I faced a few issues with, but managed to get thw calculator functioning and making sure to cover error handling such as not allowing two decimal points after each other, giving an error message when needed, removing the 0 from the screen when typing a number, using a 'calculated' function to know when to reset the display. I then added it to my portfolio with the theme switcher, and changed some designs on the portfolio. 

I faced challenges in the JS section. First with trying to do the percent button, I tried a few different ways and couldnt get it to work, then eventually used the equal button to implement changing a number to a percent. Then I just had a small issue with getting the decimal point to show on the screen, but that turned out to be a typo on the above method which was why I ended up spending so much time trying to fix the decimal method.
I used youtube for some of the JS, and looked back at assignment 3 to help with the CSS.

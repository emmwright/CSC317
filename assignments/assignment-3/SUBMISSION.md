#Analysis
I wrote the handwritten one mainly from looking over your code from your different styles. I started from the top of the page and worked my way down, using W3schools and your code. I found this easier as when I faced issues with design/positioning I was able to find where I went wrong quickly. 
When I added the style switcher bar I realised that I needed to move my image I had in my hand written style from index.html to the css file as I did not want that image in all of the different styles. 

#Lessons learned
I learnt that styling it a little bit at a time and refreshing the page with each change made is very helpful, it did seem like it is probably more time consuming and is probably not neccessary once someone is more confident in CSS but for me it made it easier to get the page exactly how I pictured it. I also learnt about targeting certain areas and using .navlist { and .navlist a {, then for the form box being able to target only the text boxers, or the label, or the button. 
When using the AI code I noticed they wrote "form input[type="submit"] " instead of "#submit", the AI version makes the code more readable and easier to understand. I also liked that it made a fade in transition on the page. 

#Preferred version
I like the hybrid one the best. I used the AI-2 and my hand written one mixed together and I think it looks the best as it is inbetween them both. The AI-2 one is too bright and block like, so the hybrid one flows better. If this wasnt a portfolio page, I may have picked the hand written one, but as this is a portfolio page the handwritten one is probably too unprofessional and girly.

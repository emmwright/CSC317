/* AI-Generated CSS with Text Prompt. */

/* Can you please generate a complete CSS file for me, I would like it to look like this:
A colour scheme of neutral lighter browns and nude type colours.
I like the monospace fonts such as Lucida Console or Monaco.
For the layout, I dont mind what it is but I dont want it to be centered and straight down the middle, something more fun.
I want the navigation links to stand out a little and have fun interactions. */

Brief description:

The group project was a fun and valuable experience that helped strengthen my skills when working with others. I learned the important of consistent communcation, effective teamwork, and strong time management. I appreciated having clear responsibilities and enjoyed working on particular parts and then watch everything come togehter well. I do generally prefer to work alone as I find it easier, but working in a team highlighted how working on particular parts can be less stressful. There was a moment where something I had spent a long time on was unintentionally broken during a merge. This was frustrating, especially as it happened close to the deadline and could have been avoided with more thorough testing before merging. However, everyone came together as a team to try and resolve the issue, and it became a valuable learning experience for all of us. It also highlighted the importance of using branches consistently â€” something not everyone had done. In any group project, something is bound to go wrong at some point, and I was impressed with how quickly everyone jumped into action to fix things. Overall, I enjoyed working in a team and appreciated the joint effect everyone put into the project.
